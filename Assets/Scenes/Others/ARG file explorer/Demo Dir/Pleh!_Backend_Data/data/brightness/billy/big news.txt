Alright chumps, we've just had a breakthrough. Like a big one. This disk is bigger than we thought, it's not just full of folders and text files. There's a game on here. Yeah. A whole fucking video game. And it's not a little arcade like game either. It's a whole developed game. You're on this spaceship and there's these cubes and this little orange thing. But the game is huge. It's the biggest thing on this disk. There could be evidence in there as well. So, we need to start cracking this game. I dunno, play through it, find what's hidden. Maybe there's something on this drive that links to the game. This changes everything. This case just got a whole lot bigger. We need to work harder.

Yours truly,
