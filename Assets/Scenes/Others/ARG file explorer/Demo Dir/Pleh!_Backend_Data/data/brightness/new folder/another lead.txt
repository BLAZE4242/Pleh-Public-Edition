Got another lead... maybe. This zip file here, "amelia". Thought it was nonsense, a code for something. Turns out this name here appears more than once. She's a person. A little more research, found her IRL. Her name is Amelia Millers, looks like she's friends with the kid at school or something. I'm organizing a date to drop by, ask her a few questions. Sure, she might just be a friend, but she could be more. She could be involved somehow. Maybe she helped him? Maybe she knows more than we do. No harm in finding out, right?

You guys are also doing a great job at getting through these files. We're getting close to something, I just know it.

Yours truly,
