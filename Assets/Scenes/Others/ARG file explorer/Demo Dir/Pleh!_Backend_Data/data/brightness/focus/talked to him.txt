I went and talked to him. That fucker. Thought I'd pay him a visit. Consider it an "interrogation". Just don't tell deputy about this one - let's keep it off the books ;). Anyway, here's what happened:

He was in one of the front rooms I think, I heard he was talking to someone? I knocked really hard on the door and I could hear I scared him. He came out and I acted friendly, yknow, not like he's □□□□□□□□□□ or anything. He denied everything. The game, being out. He thinks he's so smart. I could tell just from the look on his face he knew I knew everything. He knew he left his drive and he knew I was snooping for it. You want it back? Too bad. It's evidence now you piece of shit. I let him go back and he just started talking again. I wonder who to? His partner? His accomplice? Maybe if we find that person it'll lead to something... whatever.

Keep cracking these passwords, it'll lead us to somewhere, I just know it.
Yours truly,
□□□□□□.
