Short message here. □□□□□ managed to crack one of the users this drive has, so good on you! Promotion or something. That temp user? The password is "nothing to leave". I feel a bit dumb... not like it really gives us anything new, just some extra privileges. Just keep on investigating.

Yours truly,
