Alright, processed. He fucking killed himself. He went back there, how did no one stop him? He just walked right in, in the middle of night and did it. Back to the place... if this isn't evidence that he's the one, I don't know what is. But holy shit. I went to his house. I saw him. I actually spoke to him. And now he's dead. That's kind of really crazy. But it get's worse. Court is now dropping the investigation of Fencer, they wanna investigate his suicide. What the fuck. "It might not be a suicide" YEAH AND WE KNOW OF ONE THAT WASN'T. Still, I don't see the point in arguing, he's dead anyway, no point in continuing either investigation. I'm returning the drive to evidence locker, it'll be locked away. If you guys made any copies of anything, you gotta delete it. Sorry. I know you got so far, I'm sure we were very close to the end. I'm so sorry I let you all down. I hope his family is okay.

Yours truly,

P.S □□□□, I know, I saw the file sync as well. There's a file that wasn't on here before that got synced onto it but, we can't investigate now. It was probably nothing. Sorry.
