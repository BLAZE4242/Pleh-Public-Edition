hey, it's me, □□□□□□. So, whoever reads this, □□□, □□□□ or □□□□□ (at least I assume one of you) let me explain what the hell this is. We think this drive might have some evidence on it to prove, whatever. Yeah we know what happened for a fact, but court still needs solid evidence. The kid uploaded lots of "vlogs" on this drive, there's a few we've already cracked, if there's some kind of confession on this drive, that's what we need. I'm no computer expert but I think most stuff is... encrypted? I dunno what a .zip is but I certainly can't get into it, you guys need to do some investigating, somehow unencrypt the files, do your hacker shit. If you manage to get through, you're not allowed to read or watch any data, I know you're gonna anyway, but I legally need to let you know you're not allowed :). Crack the files, reach out when you get something, you know where to find me. Chop chop, sooner we get any evidence the better.

Yours truly,
□□□□□□.
P.S fuck this kid.
