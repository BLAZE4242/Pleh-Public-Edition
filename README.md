# Pleh! Public Edition
 This is the open-source copy of the free game [Pleh! on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2191550/Pleh).

 You're free to do whatever you want with this as long as it's not for commercial use.

## Aura 2
 A warning that this is a modified version of the official version of Pleh! as that version has a paid asset called [Aura 2](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/aura-2-volumetric-lighting-fog-137148). This public version of the game has that removed, but if you own a copy of the asset you're able to install it with the project and all Aura 2 GameObject's should reappear in scenes (Aura Cameras, Aura Lights, etc). 
 Because of the removal of the Aura 2 API, some scripts were modified, but if you would like to put them back to their original state, uncomment all lines that have "AURA HERE" and comment out all lines that have "AURA NOT HERE".

 The following scripts which included Aura 2 were modified:
 - dev_angry.cs
 - LerpSolution.cs
 - UTfall.cs
 - quizEvents.cs
 - LBW_puzzle.cs
 - Amelia_Restaurant_Cam.cs
 - AmeliaOceanManager.cs
 - devIntro_menu.cs
 - LBW_intro.cs
 - hub_undoneManager.cs
 - Amelia_Restaurant_Script.cs
 - trailler_confess.cs

 Also worth noting that a lot of scenes look different, with lights not rendering correctly without Aura 2.

 ## File size
 Due to the size of the specific file "UnderThoughts Part 2.unity" (137mb) the file had to be cut down. You'll notice that when you launch that scene a large amount of the stairs below are missing. If you want to download the original version of this file you can do so [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NU-_aRgIihtVoSFQKpIhOnhj-hPMx5FS/view?usp=sharing).
